# Friday Night Funkin': Summer Break Special
![](/_polymod_icon.png)

ANOTHER azumanga mod to the ever-expanding pile - made as a mod folder for the Friday Night Funkin' V-Slice (aka base game)

## what's added in this?
- MOST menus overhauled and/or changed (inspired by Azumanga Donjara Daioh (PS1) and Azumanga Daioh Advance (GBA))
- full week against tomo
- one bonus song (scary...)
